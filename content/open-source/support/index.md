# Open source support & consulting

I maintain several [open source projects](/open-source/) that are used in production. If you're using one of these projects in a commercial setting and want help beyond what the documentation covers, I offer paid support and consulting.

Typical things I help with include:

- Getting a project up and running in an existing stack
- Architectural advice and best practices
- Custom features or extensions
- Debugging tricky production issues
- Ongoing maintenance and guidance

Support is usually provided as a short engagement or billed by the hour. You'll work directly with me, without layers of process or ticket systems.

## Who this is for

This is intended for companies and teams that rely on my open source projects in production.  

It's probably not a good fit for hobby projects, student work, or general programming questions unrelated to these projects.
