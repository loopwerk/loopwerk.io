# Once again I turn to Appcelerator
After I [decided](/articles/2010/getting-started-iphone-app-development/) to create iPhone apps using just the iPhone SDK and the Objective-C language, I've created [two iPhone apps](http://itunes.apple.com/nl/artist/goldmund-wyldebeast-wunderliebe/id380925906) that are available in the Dutch App Store. Development for app number three has started today, but no longer will I be using Xcode.

What gives? Well, the client wants an Android app too. Of course I could build the iPhone version with Xcode, the SDK and Objective-C and create the Android version from scratch after that's finished. But I don't really know Java and don't feel like learning yet another mobile SDK. So, back to [Appcelerator](http://www.appcelerator.com/) it is! I have to say, so far so good: progress is incredibly fast and the skeleton app I've created so far indeed builds for iPhone and Android.

I do wonder if progress will stay this fast. Last time I've used Appcelerator, I gave up once I wanted to do more complicated things and support was hard to get. Given that this app is pretty simple though, I have high hopes. If I come across cool tricks or problems, I'll let you know.
