# The software and hardware I use

Inspired by [uses.tech](https://uses.tech).

This is the stuff I use daily for development, photography, and gaming. I don’t upgrade often, but when I do it’s usually because something genuinely annoys me, not because there’s a new version.

## Hardware

### Computer hardware

My desk setup is built around one screen for everything: work, gaming, and movies. The ultrawide makes it possible.

* MacBook Pro (14” M1 Max, 32 GB) - still running macOS 15. After all these years it's still incredibly fast, and I see no reason to upgrade.
* LG 38WN95CP-W 38" ultrawide - 3840 x 1600 resolution, absolutely perfect for productivity, gaming, watching movies. Love it.
* Logitech MX Keys - great keyboard, extremely good battery life. Can connect to three devices; I use it for my MacBook and my gaming PC.
* Apple Magic Trackpad - I much prefer a trackpad over a mouse for everyday use. Gestures!
* Gaming PC (Ryzen 7 9800X3D, RTX 5080) - connected to the same LG ultrawide.
* Logitech G502X gaming mouse - connected to my game PC. I never touch a mouse on macOS.

### Gadgets

The usual collection of devices that follow me around.

* iPhone 14 Pro with 128 GB storage - still running iOS 18. Like the MacBook, it still works perfectly fine and I'm in no rush to upgrade.
* 2018 iPad Pro 12.9" - mostly used for watching YouTube and the occasional web browsing. It's showing its age but still gets the job done.
* Steam Deck OLED - perfect for playing PC games from the couch or in bed. Valve really nailed this one.
* Home Assistant Green - the brains of my smart home. Controls all my lights, sensors, and automations.
* [Mondaine watch](https://www.mondaine.nl/evo2-zwart-40-mm-144956877.html) - a simple, beautiful black watch with the iconic Swiss railway clock. No smart features, no notifications, not even the date; just the time.
* Sony PS5 controller - I prefer most PC games with a controller, and Sony makes the best one.
* [Ozlo Sleepbuds](https://ozlosleep.com) - they play white noise and block out external sound. They help me sleep a lot better.

### Audio

Music is my life. I'm always listening to something, singing along. It gets me in the zone when working.

* [Kef LSX II](https://us.kef.com/products/lsx-2) speakers - connected to both the MacBook and gaming PC. The remote control sucks, but the sound is good.
* Audio-Technica ATH-M50X - for use at my computer, when I'm not using the speakers. All-day comfort and good sound. I replaced the ear cushions with [cheap velour ones](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0148RAQCW/ref=pe_3044161_189395811_TE_dp_1) in 2017, and they're still going strong.
* Apple AirPods Pro 2 - when I'm out and about. The noise cancellation is excellent and they pair seamlessly with all my Apple devices.
* Apple HomePod mini - in the kitchen for listening to podcasts while cooking.
* Sonos system (one Play:5 and a pair of Play:1s) - in the living room. For music, but could double as a surround sound system when needed.
* Audio-Technica AT-LP120X record player - connected to the Sonos Play:5. There's something about putting on a record that streaming just can't replicate.

### Photography

I shoot Fujifilm. Small cameras, great colors, beautiful lenses. Philosophically I prefer Leica's minimalist approach, but Fuji is a good and much more affordable alternative.

* Fujifilm X-E4 - tiny, lightweight, and a joy to shoot with. Fujifilm's film simulations mean I rarely need to edit my photos.
* XF 35mm F1.4 R - my favorite walking around lens. Beautifully sharp with gorgeous bokeh. Lives on the camera most of the time.
* XF 16-80mm F4 R OIS WR - the versatile zoom for travel and anything where I don't want to swap lenses.
* Fujifilm Instax Share SP-2 printer - prints instant photos straight from my phone. Great for gifts or sticking photos on the fridge.

### Office

Where I spend most of my waking hours, so it better be comfortable.

* [Herman Miller Mirra 2 Butterfly](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/mirra-2-chair/) chair - it's not cheap, but compared to other Herman Miller chairs it's a bargain.
* [Holmris Q20](https://www.holmrisb8.com/holmris-b8-collection/q20-work-desk/) standing desk - 180 x 80 cm. I try to alternate between sitting and standing throughout the day, although usually I forget.
* [Stadler Form Oskar BIG](https://www.stadlerform.com/en/humidifier/oskar-big-white-o-040) humidifier - essential during the dry winter months. Makes a real difference in comfort.
* [Rain Design mStand](https://raindesigninc.com/products/mstand) for the MacBook - elevates the MacBook to a comfortable height next to the ultrawide.
* Brother HL-L2340D laser printer. [Consistently the best printer to buy.](https://www.theverge.com/tech/641940/best-printer-2025-just-buy-a-brother-laser-printer-middle-finger-in-the-air)

### Networking gear

I went all-in on Ubiquiti's UniFi ecosystem. This setup might be overkill for most people, but the reliability and control are hard to beat. I've had too many mesh network systems in the past that I had to reboot almost daily, and finally gave in and replaced it all with UniFi.

* [Dream Machine Special Edition](https://techspecs.ui.com/unifi/cloud-gateways/udm-se) - my internet router, 8-port POE switch, and security camera recorder, all in one box.
* [Ultra 60W](https://techspecs.ui.com/unifi/switching/usw-ultra-60w) - 8-port POE switch for the other side of the house.
* [U7 Lite](https://techspecs.ui.com/unifi/wifi/u7-lite) - WiFi 7 access point on the ground floor.
* [U6+](https://techspecs.ui.com/unifi/wifi/u6-plus) - WiFi 6 access point on the first floor.
* [G6 Bullet](https://techspecs.ui.com/unifi/cameras-nvrs/uvc-g6-bullet) - outdoor security camera. Recordings are stored locally on the Dream Machine, no cloud subscription needed.

## Software

### Organization

Nothing fancy here. Apple's built-in apps do the job and sync across all my devices.

* Apple Calendar - syncs across all my devices, does what I need. No complaints.
* Apple Notes - for quick notes and checklists. Nothing fancy, but it's always there. Handles sensitive data using locked notes.
* Apple Contacts - again, it just works and syncs everywhere.

### Communication

I keep it simple and mostly stick with Apple's defaults.

* Apple Mail - I've tried a bunch of other mail clients in the past, but Apple's Mail app works perfectly fine for me.
* Slack - I don't really like it, but my clients use it 🤷‍♂️
* iMessage - here in Europe almost everybody uses WhatsApp, but I refuse to.
* Google Meet - with clients. All of a sudden nobody uses Zoom anymore.

### Development

My daily drivers for writing code, managing databases, and testing APIs.

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - for Python and TypeScript projects. I don't really have any complaints, it's just a really good editor. I don't see myself switching to something else.
* Xcode - for Swift projects (this website, [Saga](https://github.com/loopwerk/Saga), [Parsley](https://github.com/loopwerk/Parsley), [Moon](https://github.com/loopwerk/Moon)). It's meh, but there's no real alternative for Swift development.
* [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org) - my terminal of choice, with Fish as my shell. Fast, native, and stays out of the way. Check my [dotfiles](https://github.com/kevinrenskers/dotfiles).
* [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com) - this has completely replaced Postman for all API / HTTP testing. It's fast, offline, and stores requests as plain files. Brilliant piece of software.
* [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) - I really do not like git's command line interface, so I use a GUI. I'd love to use [Fork](https://git-fork.com) instead of this Atlassian-owned software, but sadly it's [usable](https://github.com/fork-dev/Tracker/issues/785) for colorblind people.
* [Postico 2](https://eggerapps.at/postico2/) - PostgreSQL browser. Clean interface, makes it easy to browse and query databases during development.

### AI

I use AI as a tool, not a replacement. It handles the tedious parts so I can focus on the interesting ones.

* ChatGPT - I use this every day.
* Claude Code - I'm starting to use it more and more, but I still check every single line of code. It doesn't really save me a lot of time overall, but it does the tedious parts which is nice.

### Design / photography

I'm not a designer, but I do enough image editing and color picking to need a few good tools.

* Apple Photos - where all my pictures live. I'm not super happy with it, but it integrates really well with the rest of the ecosystem. Photos are on iCloud, where I pay for 1 TB of storage.
* [Acorn](https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/) - for all simple image editing. Resize, crop, annotate. It's like a lightweight Photoshop without the subscription.
* [Affinity](https://www.affinity.studio) - for vector editing. A proper Illustrator alternative, and it's free!
* [ColorSnapper 2](https://colorsnapper.com) - system-wide color picker. Handy for grabbing colors from designs or websites.

### Media

Short and sweet: Apple Music and VLC cover all my needs.

* Apple Music - I'm a happy subscriber to Apple Music. Spotify hasn't won me over.
* [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) - for watching videos. Plays anything you throw at it, no questions asked.

### Browsers

Three browsers, each with its own job.

* Safari - still my browser of choice. It syncs all my bookmarks and reading list, is integrated with Apple's Passwords app, works with work and personal profiles, and is fast.
* [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/app) web browser - I exclusively use it to watch YouTube, because its video player doesn't play any ads.
* [Firefox](https://www.firefox.com/) - just for testing websites. Every web developer needs a second browser.

### Productivity

Small utilities and writing tools that make daily life on macOS a little smoother.

* [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) - my preferred Markdown editor, used for all long-form writing. Distraction-free, it gets out of the way so I can focus on the words.
* [iA Presenter](https://ia.net/presenter) - for making beautiful presentations powered by Markdown. Write your content, and it handles the design.
* [Pure Paste](https://sindresorhus.com/pure-paste) - automatically clears formatting when pasting. One of those tiny utilities that should be built into macOS.
* [Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/) - emoji autocomplete on macOS. Type a colon, start typing a name, and pick your emoji. Much faster than the built-in emoji picker.

### iOS apps

On my phone I try to keep things very minimal with only two pages of apps, but a few apps have earned a permanent spot.

* [Unread](https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/unread/) - my favorite RSS reader. I do pass all RSS feeds through [RSS Filter](https://rssfilter.com).
* Google Maps - I'd prefer not to use Google products at all, but I really don't like Apple Maps. The fact I can't have a light map in dark mode is crazy. Also the quality of business info and driving directions are simply not as good.
* Waze - for driving I use Waze instead of Google Maps. Way better UI, way better voices. I haven't found a better alternative yet.
* Apple Podcasts - it works "good enough", but only barely. Still on the lookout for a better alternative.
* [Ivory](https://tapbots.com/ivory/) - a really good paid Mastodon client. On macOS I simply use the website.
* GitHub - on macOS I simply use the website, but on mobile I do prefer their native app. It's good.
* Home - I control my whole smart home from it, [bridged from Home Assistant](/articles/2025/home-assistant-setup/).
* [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com) - I exclusively use it to watch YouTube on my iPad, since DuckDuckGo doesn't have an iPad browser.
* Apple Camera - I've tried a few other camera apps, but since I refuse to get a monthly subscription for a camera app, I just keep coming back to the default camera app. It's fine.

### Cloud software

The services that keep everything running behind the scenes.

* [Migadu](https://migadu.com) - email hosting for my custom domains. Simple, affordable, and privacy-focused. No frills, just reliable email.
* [Harvest](https://harvestapp.com) - time tracking and invoicing. It's simple and gets the job done for freelance work.
* Hosting stack: Debian, PostgreSQL, [Coolify](https://coolify.io) - I self-host my side projects on Hetzner VPS. Coolify makes deploying Docker containers super easy.
* [Kagi](https://kagi.com/) - paid search engine which uses Google's index under the hood, but without Google tracking you across the web. You pay with money instead of your data.
* [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io) - a self-hosted, privacy-friendly alternative to Google Analytics. Lightweight, no cookies, and I own all the data.
* [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) - it's why all my domains and DNS records live, it blocks bots, and works as a global CDN. All for free.
* Mastodon - I'm on [hachyderm.io](https://hachyderm.io/@kevinrenskers).
