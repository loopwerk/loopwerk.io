# Announcing django-generic-notifications 1.0.0

Back in 2011, I started a small Django package called [django-generic-notifications](https://github.com/loopwerk/django-generic-notifications). It was built for a project I was working on at the time, got seven releases over a few months... and then it more or less died. Once I moved on from that original project, there wasnâ€™t much reason to keep maintaining the library. It never gained a big user base, no pull requests or issues came in, and eventually I archived the repository.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, and I found myself needing a good, flexible notification system for a new Django project. I checked out a few third-party options, but none of them quite fit what I had in mind. I wasnâ€™t super eager to revive django-generic-notifications â€” it was very old, still using South for migrations (yes, that old) â€” but in the end, I decided to bring it back to life. Or rather, to start fresh.

So here it is: version 1.0.0 of django-generic-notifications. A complete rewrite, with the same core architecture but a modern, cleaned-up implementation. Itâ€™s more flexible, more powerful, and a lot more useful.

## What is django-generic-notifications?

At its core, this package helps you send notifications to your users through different channels like email or your website. Itâ€™s built around the idea of defining notification types in your code, and then letting the library handle how and when to deliver them to your users.

Want to show a bell icon on your website when a user gets a new comment? Easy. Want to send them a weekly email digest with grouped notifications? Also easy. Want to build your own Slack or push notification integration? Go for it.

## Highlights

- **Channels**: The old concept of "backends" is now called "channels", and we ship two out of the box: `website` and `email`.
- **Website notifications**: Finally a built-in way to show notifications on your site. The old version never included this, which in hindsight is kind of wild.
- **Email digests**: Daily or weekly summaries of all pending notifications, grouped and nicely formatted.
- **Notification grouping**: Avoid spamming users with multiple similar notifications: group them together automatically.
- **Simplified internals**: No more built-in queuing system, no assumptions about how your custom channels should process notifications. Just plug in your own logic.
- **Customizable**: Choose which channels a notification must go through and build your own delivery logic if needed.
- **Tested**: Yes, we have unit tests now ðŸŽ‰
- **Example project**: Included in the repo to help you get started quickly.
