# Announcing spamusement.cc

Remember the brilliant webcomic Spamusement.com, with the tag line "Poorly-drawn cartoons inspired by actual spam subject lines”?

Like this one, titled “Your Dog Will Love It!”

Spamusement.com was created by Steven Frank (yes, [that one](https://stevenf.com)) in 2004, and was updated until 2007. Sadly the website went offline in 2020 and the only way to access those comics now is with the Internet Archive, which is very slow, and it blocks you after you quickly access multiple pages in a row.

I missed it so much that I put online an archive: [spamusement.cc](https://www.spamusement.cc).
