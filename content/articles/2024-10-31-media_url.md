# How to change MEDIA_URL for one FileField

In my Django project I use the following `MEDIA_URL` inside of `settings.py`:

``` python
MEDIA_URL = "https://ik.imagekit.io/my_org_name/my_project_name/"
```

This routes all images through [ImageKit](https://imagekit.io), which automatically resizes them based on the visitor’s device and resolution, serves big PNG and JPG images as WebP when the browser supports it, and serves as a global CDN which caches the images. It’s pretty nice.

We have a `photo_id` file field in one of our models:

``` python
class VerificationQueue(models.Model):
    photo_id = models.FileField()
    # ... other fields
```

This is for users to get verified, and once the photo ID has been processed we immediately delete the file. We **absolutely do not want this image to go through ImageKit**. A simple solution for this is using a custom storage class:

``` python
from django.core.files.storage import FileSystemStorage

class NoImageKitStorage(FileSystemStorage):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        kwargs["base_url"] = "/media/"
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        
class VerificationQueue(models.Model):
    photo_id = models.FileField(/*HLS*/storage=NoImageKitStorage()/*HLE*/)
```

So now when an admin looks at the photo ID, it doesn’t go through ImageKit, and it doesn’t get cached by them. I love it when a solution is so simple, thanks Django!
