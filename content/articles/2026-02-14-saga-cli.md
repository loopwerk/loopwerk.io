# Announcing the Saga CLI

[Saga](https://github.com/loopwerk/Saga) is a static site generator written in Swift, and it just got a lot easier to get started with. Saga now has a companion CLI tool with three commands: `saga init`, `saga build`, and `saga dev`.

## Installation

You can install the CLI system-wide via Homebrew:

```shell-session
$ brew install loopwerk/tap/saga
```

Or via Mint:

```shell-session
$ mint install loopwerk/Saga
```

## Getting started

Once installed, scaffolding a new project is a single command:

```shell-session
$ saga init mysite
$ cd mysite
$ saga dev
```

`saga init` gives you a complete project with articles, tags, templates, and a stylesheet, ready to build and serve. No need to set up a `Package.swift` by hand or figure out the right dependencies.

## The dev server

`saga dev` watches your content and source folders, triggers a rebuild when a file changes, and live-reloads the browser. It works on both macOS and Linux, so developing or deploying on a Linux server is no problem.

## Building for production

`saga build` compiles your site and writes the output, ready to deploy.

## Why this matters

Saga has always been a code-first tool: no config files, no implicit behavior, no magic conventions. But that also meant the setup was entirely manual. The new CLI removes that friction. You can go from zero to a running site in seconds, while still having full control over the pipeline in Swift.

If you're curious, I recently wrote a [real-world comparison of Hugo, Publish, and Saga](/articles/2026/hugo-vs-publish-vs-saga/) that goes into much more detail about how the three generators compare.
