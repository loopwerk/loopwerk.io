# Hi! I'm Kevin Renskers, an independent software engineer.

I help teams design and build maintainable web software, migrate away from fragile tooling, and improve code quality and developer experience. My focus is on Python, Django, and modern TypeScript.

I’ve been working as a freelance developer under the name Loopwerk since 2016, fixing and finishing projects for international clients such as Last.fm, Sentry, WeTransfer, and Unilever.

On this site you'll find my technical writing, open-source work, and information about working with me.
