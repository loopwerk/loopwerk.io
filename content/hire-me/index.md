# Hire me

I created my first website in 2000 and my first iOS app in 2010. I’ve been working as a fully remote freelance developer since 2016, fixing and finishing projects for international clients such as CBS, Last.fm, Sentry, WeTransfer and Unilever, so you’re in good hands. You can find my portfolio on the  [Apps](/apps/) page.

I’ve also mentored multiple junior developers, both at other companies and in my own [mentorship program](/mentor/).

### Tech
Technologies and tools I use include HTML, CSS, Tailwind, Python, Django, Django REST Framework, htmx, Alpine, Alpine AJAX, uv, ruff, JavaScript, TypeScript, SvelteKit, Swift, UIKit, SwiftUI, git, GitHub, macOS, Debian, Coolify, VS Code, and Xcode.

But the list keeps on growing and if your tech stack doesn’t completely match mine, let’s talk anyway.

### Ethics and turn-offs
I will not work on anything related to the promotion of fossil fuels, gambling, tobacco, alcohol, firearms, bitcoin, or blockchains.

I do not use PHP, Wordpress, Windows, or React, and have no interest in doing so.

### Remote only
I work fully remote from my own office in Winterswijk, the Netherlands. I work four days a week for clients, with one day a week reserved for open source work and side projects.

### Let’s work together!
You can expect a healthy dose of Dutch honesty from me. I’ll just tell you how it is, what needs to be fixed, without the bullshit. I think our industry could use some more honesty and better ethics. If all of that sounds good, then let’s work together!
