# Hire me

I created my first website in 2000 and my first iOS app in 2010. I’ve been working as a fully remote freelance developer since 2016, finishing and fixing projects for international clients such as CBS, Last.fm, Sentry, WeTransfer, Unilever and Emmy and Oscar winner Sound Radix, so you’re in good hands. You can find my portfolio on the [Apps](/apps/) page.

I’ve also mentored multiple junior developers, both at other companies and in my own [mentorship program](/mentor/).

### My philosophy: keep it simple

Over my 25 years of experience, [I’ve learned that the best solution is often the simplest one](/articles/2025/25-years-chasing-simplicity/). I believe in building robust, maintainable software by avoiding unnecessary complexity. My goal is to deliver clean, straightforward code that solves complex problems effectively, and which can still be understood a year later. Left unchecked, complexity will always creep in, and you have to actively seek out and defend simplicity.

### What clients say

> "Kevin is a highly skilled software engineer with a wide breadth of experience allowing him to work across the product sphere. His insight, talent, and network proved invaluable when building our team and product. **He has an exceptional understanding of product development and design** and keeps the rest of the team focused on the user experience. Kevin is a thought leader and someone I wouldn't hesitate to work with again."
>
> <cite>&mdash; Michael Hodges, former CTO at Skippit</cite>

> "From the moment he joined our development team **the quality of the code base increased quickly and our release cycles shortened significantly.** Kevin also has a healthy knowledge of UX and UI, which made me and the team always consider his fresh valuable input. Except for being a solid rock in your team, Kevin is also just a super nice and pleasant guy. I truly enjoyed having his peaceful personality around and I hope, maybe one day, we can embark on a new adventure together once again. "
>
> <cite>&mdash; Bert Verstappen, former Project Manager at Tessa (a Unilever project)</cite>

> “I worked with Kevin on the Last.fm Scrobbler App for iOS. The app was a very complicated and challenging build that had to be completed to a tight deadline. From the first day of development Kevin proved to be personally invested in the project, suggesting ways to make it more powerful and useful, ideas that resulted in great user feedback. [...] **the app was fully fleshed out and crash free so early in the process that we could focus on performance, and even add a few features.**”

### Tech

Technologies and tools I use include:

*   **Languages:** Python, Swift, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS.
*   **Frameworks & libraries:** Django, Django REST Framework, SvelteKit, UIKit, SwiftUI, Tailwind, htmx, Alpine, Alpine AJAX.
*   **Tools & platforms:** Git, GitHub, macOS, Debian, Coolify, uv, ruff, Claude Code, VS Code, and Xcode.

But the list keeps on growing and if your tech stack doesn’t completely match mine, let’s talk anyway.

### Ethics and turn-offs
I will not work on anything related to the promotion of fossil fuels, gambling, tobacco, alcohol, firearms, bitcoin, or blockchains.

I do not use PHP, Wordpress, Windows, or React, and have no interest in doing so.

### Remote only
I work fully remote from my own office in Winterswijk, the Netherlands. I work four days a week for clients, with one day a week reserved for open source work and side projects.

### Let’s work together!
You can expect a healthy dose of Dutch honesty from me. I’ll just tell you how it is, what needs to be fixed, without the sugar-coating. I think our industry could use some more honesty and better ethics. If all of that sounds good, then let’s work together!
