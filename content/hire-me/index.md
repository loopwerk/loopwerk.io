# Hire me

I’m a creative product-minded software engineer with a strong background in web development and backend systems, and a long-standing passion for good design and usability.

I enjoy working on the "back-of-the-front-end": building clean APIs, thoughtful data models, and well-structured systems that enable great user experiences. I care deeply about API design, documentation, and code quality, and I value pragmatic solutions that balance clarity, maintainability, and performance.

Over the years I’ve worked across the full stack and on multiple platforms. My focus is firmly on web and backend development using Python, Django, and modern JavaScript/TypeScript frameworks, while my background in mobile development continues to inform how I think about product design.

I've been online since 1994, creating websites since 2000 and iOS apps since 2010. I've been working as a fully remote freelance developer since 2016, fixing and finishing projects for international clients such as CBS, Last.fm, Sentry, WeTransfer, Unilever and Emmy and Oscar winner Sound Radix.

Mentoring junior developers brings me great joy, which I've done both at other companies and in my own [mentorship program](/mentor/).

My CV can be downloaded [here](/about/KevinRenskers.pdf).

## My philosophy: keep it simple

Over my 25 years of experience, [I've learned that the best solution is often the simplest one](/articles/2025/25-years-chasing-simplicity/). I believe in building robust, maintainable software by avoiding unnecessary complexity. My goal is to deliver clean, straightforward code that solves complex problems effectively, and which can still be understood a year later. Left unchecked, complexity will always creep in, and you have to actively seek out and defend simplicity.

## What clients say

Michael Hodges, former CTO at Skippit:

> Kevin is a highly skilled software engineer with a wide breadth of experience allowing him to work across the product sphere. His insight and talent proved invaluable when building our team and product. **He has an exceptional understanding of product development and design** and keeps the rest of the team focused on the user experience. Kevin is a thought leader and someone I wouldn't hesitate to work with again.

Bert Verstappen, former Project Manager at Tessa (a Unilever project):

> From the moment he joined our development team **the quality of the code base increased quickly and our release cycles shortened significantly.** Kevin also has a healthy knowledge of UX and UI, which made me and the team always consider his valuable input. Besides being a solid rock in your team, Kevin is also just a super nice and pleasant guy.

Dan Raviv, CTO at Sound Radix:

> Kevin is the most professional full-stack web developer I’ve worked with. It’s very hard to find engineers who take pride in their craft and are also able to take end-to-end project ownership; Kevin did just that at Sound Radix and reworked our entire website, **improving the UX as well as internals beyond recognition**. I had complete confidence in Kevin to handle any technical challenge on his own.

## Tech

Technologies and tools I use include:

- **Languages:** Python, Swift, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS.
- **Frameworks & libraries:** Django, Django REST Framework, SvelteKit, UIKit, SwiftUI, Tailwind, htmx, Alpine, Alpine AJAX.
- **Tools & platforms:** Git, GitHub, macOS, Debian, Coolify, uv, ruff, Claude Code, VS Code, and Xcode.

But the list keeps on growing and if your tech stack doesn't completely match mine, let's talk anyway.

## Ethics and turn-offs

I will not work on anything related to the promotion of fossil fuels, gambling, tobacco, alcohol, firearms, bitcoin, or blockchains.

I do not use PHP, Wordpress, Windows, or React, and have no interest in doing so.

## Remote only

I work fully remote from my own office in Winterswijk, the Netherlands. I work four days a week for clients, with one day a week reserved for open source work and side projects.

## Let's work together!
