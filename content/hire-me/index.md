# Hire me

I’m a creative product-minded software engineer with a strong background in web development and backend systems, and a long-standing passion for good design and usability.

I enjoy working on the “back-of-the-front-end”: building clean APIs, thoughtful data models, and well-structured systems that enable great user experiences. I care deeply about API design, documentation, and code quality, and I value pragmatic solutions that balance clarity, maintainability, and performance. 

Over the years I’ve worked across the full stack and on multiple platforms. My focus is firmly on web and backend development using Python, Django, and modern JavaScript/TypeScript frameworks, while my background in mobile development continues to inform how I think about product design.

I created my first website in 2000 and my first iOS app in 2010. I've been working as a fully remote freelance developer since 2016, fixing and finishing projects for international clients such as CBS, Last.fm, Sentry, WeTransfer, Unilever and Emmy and Oscar winner Sound Radix, so you're in good hands. You can find my portfolio on the [Apps](/apps/) page, and my CV can be downloaded [here](/about/KevinRenskers.pdf).

I've also mentored multiple junior developers, both at other companies and in my own [mentorship program](/mentor/).

### My philosophy: keep it simple

Over my 25 years of experience, [I've learned that the best solution is often the simplest one](/articles/2025/25-years-chasing-simplicity/). I believe in building robust, maintainable software by avoiding unnecessary complexity. My goal is to deliver clean, straightforward code that solves complex problems effectively, and which can still be understood a year later. Left unchecked, complexity will always creep in, and you have to actively seek out and defend simplicity.

### What clients say

> "Kevin is a highly skilled software engineer with a wide breadth of experience allowing him to work across the product sphere. His insight, talent, and network proved invaluable when building our team and product. **He has an exceptional understanding of product development and design** and keeps the rest of the team focused on the user experience. Kevin is a thought leader and someone I wouldn't hesitate to work with again."
>
> <cite>&mdash; Michael Hodges, former CTO at Skippit</cite>

> "From the moment he joined our development team **the quality of the code base increased quickly and our release cycles shortened significantly.** Kevin also has a healthy knowledge of UX and UI, which made me and the team always consider his fresh valuable input. Besides being a solid rock in your team, Kevin is also just a super nice and pleasant guy. I truly enjoyed having his peaceful personality around."
>
> <cite>&mdash; Bert Verstappen, former Project Manager at Tessa (a Unilever project)</cite>

> "I worked with Kevin on the Last.fm Scrobbler App for iOS. The app was a very complicated and challenging build that had to be completed to a tight deadline. From the first day of development Kevin proved to be personally invested in the project, suggesting ways to make it more powerful and useful, ideas that resulted in great user feedback. Amazingly, **the app was fully fleshed out and crash free so early in the process that we could focus on performance, and even add a few features.**"
