# Mentorship Program
Since January 2021 I am offering a Mentorship Program, where using one-on-one video calls, screen sharing and pair programming I will help you level up as a **web developer**. This Mentorship Program is completely free; I donate a few hours every week to help underprivileged people from the developer community.

From 2021 to 2023 this Mentorship Program was focused on iOS development, but since 2024 I refocused back on the open web and as such the Mentorship Program will also focus on web development -- specifically HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Svelte and SvelteKit, Python, Django and Django REST Framework.

Please note that I do not use React, I am not a fan of React, and I cannot give support on React code and projects.

## What can you expect from this program?
My goal is to build a bond, where we have a weekly meeting of about an hour, over the course of multiple weeks or even months. I'm not really interested in one-off meetings where I answer one specific question one time and then never hear from you again.

So what will we discuss in these meetings? Maybe you're stuck on a problem and need some help. Or you want somebody to look over existing code to get their opinion, about possible improvements. We can discuss the architecture of your web app or API, testing strategies, whatever you can think of. I'm not an expert in literally every aspect of web development (even with twenty years of experience you can never know everything), but I'll do my best to help you where I can. 

## What do I expect from you?
You're going to need a good enough internet connection to talk and share your screen. You need to be able to speak English or Dutch. You're going to need at least a basic understanding of HTML, JavaScript and/or Python - I can't teach you that from scratch.

Finally, as my preferred "office hours" are from 16:00 to 17:00 [Central European Time](https://time.is/CET) (Amsterdam), our schedules have to match as well. This means that it's probably quite hard to schedule meetings if you're in the United States for example.
