# About me

Hi there! 

My name is **Kevin Renskers**, and I’m a creative software developer with a passion for good usability and great design. I love working on intuitive, user friendly interfaces and their APIs. 

I created my first website in 2000 and my first iOS app in 2010. I’ve been working as a fully remote freelance developer since 2016, fixing projects for international clients such as CBS, Last.fm, Sentry, WeTransfer and Unilever. I’ve mentored multiple junior developers, both at other companies and in my own [mentorship program](/mentor/).

You can expect a healthy dose of Dutch honesty from me. I’ll just tell you how it is, what needs to be fixed, without the bullshit. I think our industry could use some more honesty and better ethics.

 You can find my open source projects on [Open Source](/projects/) and a portfolio of apps I've created on [Apps](/apps/). My CV, if you need it, can be downloaded [here](/about/KevinRenskers.pdf).

Email me at <kevin@loopwerk.io> to discuss your project, or reach out to me on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@kevinrenskers) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinrenskers/).

*"Kevin has a good knowledge of user experience and design, and even his earliest builds were solid and usable. Amazingly, the app was fully fleshed out and crash free so early that we could focus on performance, and even add a few features. Honestly, he's one of the best developers I've ever worked with." - Graham, designer at Last.fm*
