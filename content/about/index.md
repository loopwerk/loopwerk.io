# About me

# Goedendag! 
My name is **Kevin Renskers**.

Iâ€™m a creative developer with a passion for good design and intuitive, user friendly interfaces. I love working on the front end, whether that's creating a beautiful and performant iOS app or using HTML, CSS and TypeScript to create interactive and responsive web apps. I also like working on the back end: I use Python and the Django framework, or Swift with the Vapor framework, to create developer-friendly APIs for those apps.

Usability and design are always on my mind, even when writing code: this should be usable, readable and beautiful too.

I've been online since 1994, creating websites since 2000 and iOS apps since 2010, so you could say I am experienced. You can find my open source projects on [Open Source](/projects/) and a portfolio of apps I've created on [Apps](/apps/). My CV, if you need it, can be downloaded [here](/about/KevinRenskers.pdf).

Email me at <kevin@loopwerk.io> to discuss your project, or reach out to me on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@kevinrenskers) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinrenskers/).

*"Kevin has a good knowledge of user experience and design, and even his earliest builds were solid and usable. Amazingly, the app was fully fleshed out and crash free so early that we could focus on performance, and even add a few features. Honestly, he's one of the best developers I've ever worked with." - Graham, designer at Last.fm*
