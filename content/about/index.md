# About me

Hi there! My name is **Kevin Renskers**, and I’m a creative software developer with a passion for good usability and great design. I love working on intuitive, user friendly interfaces and their APIs.

I created my first website in 2000, and got my first job as a PHP developer in 2001. In 2009 I switched to **Python** and **Django**, and in 2010 I created my first **iOS** app. I’ve been a fully remote freelance software developer since 2016, working for international clients such as CBS, Last.fm, Sentry, WeTransfer and Unilever. In 2023 I switched my focus from doing mostly iOS work back towards the open web.

My hobbies and interests include playing PC games, playing Dungeons & Dragons, watching tv shows (a list of my all-time favs can be [found on IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls047084150/)), cooking, photography and architecture. 

I built [Critical Notes](https://www.critical-notes.com), I maintain a bunch of [open source projects](/projects/), and I’m a member of the [Django Software Foundation](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/).

I choose cats over dogs, tea over coffee, and winter over summer. I’ve lived in Iceland for almost four years, and I still speak Icelandic to my cat Mia. My favorite foods are ramen, hamburgers and tacos.

You can reach me via email at <kevin@loopwerk.io>, on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@kevinrenskers), and I am also (reluctantly) on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinrenskers/).
