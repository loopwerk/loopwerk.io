# About me

Hi there! My name is **Kevin Renskers**, and I'm a creative product-minded software developer with a passion for good usability and great design. I love working on intuitive, user-friendly interfaces and the APIs behind them.

I created my first website in 2000, and got my first job as a PHP developer in 2001. In 2009 I switched to **Python** and **Django**, and in 2010 I created my first **iOS** app. I've been a fully remote freelance software developer since 2016, working for international clients such as CBS, Last.fm, Sentry, WeTransfer, Unilever, and Emmy and Oscar winner Sound Radix. In 2023 I shifted my focus from mostly iOS work back to the open web.

My hobbies and interests include playing PC games, playing Dungeons & Dragons, watching tv shows (a list of my all-time favs can be [found on IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls047084150/)), cooking, [photography](https://glass.photo/kevinrenskers) and architecture.

Some of my all-time favorites PC games include The Last of Us, Lies of P, Uncharted, Crusader Kings III, Europa Universalis IV, Cyberpunk 2077, Elden Ring, Baldur's Gate 3, Divinity: Original Sin 2, Horizon Zero Dawn, God of War, Brotato, Rainbow Six Vegas, Titanfall 2, Dishonored, Hades, No Rest for the Wicked, and No One Lives Forever.

I built [Critical Notes](https://www.critical-notes.com), I maintain a bunch of [open source projects](/projects/), and I'm a member of the [Django Software Foundation](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/).

I choose cats over dogs, tea over coffee, and winter over summer. I've lived in Iceland for almost four years, and my favorite foods are ramen, hamburgers, tacos, and Thai.
