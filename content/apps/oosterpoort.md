#  Agenda Oosterpoort Stadsschouwburg Groningen
My first iOS app, created in 2010. At first I wanted to use Appcelerator Titanium because I didn't know any Objective-c, but quickly [changed my mind](/articles/2010/getting-started-iphone-app-development/) and learned the proper skills instead. I actually rewrote the entire app after I submitted the "Agenda Groninger Forum" app, because I learned so much in such a short time and wasn't happy with my first effort anymore - the curse of every good developer.

This app shows the program for a local theater and its Twitter feed.
