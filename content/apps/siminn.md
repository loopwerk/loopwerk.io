Live streaming TV and video on demand for Síminn, an Icelandic media company. The catalogue browser is entirely remote-controlled: each page consists of structure- and layout JSON files personalized for the logged in user, comparable with HTML and CSS, respectively. Síminn can change the look and feel and even the navigation structure without ever having to upload a new app to the App Store. The TV player shows the full program guide in an innovative interface that doesn't get in your way.
