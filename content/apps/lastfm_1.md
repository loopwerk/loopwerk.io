#  Scrobbler for iOS
"A new iOS music player that helps you rediscover the music you own. The Scrobbler is a fully-featured music player that helps you discover connections between the tracks in your iTunes library through playlists, deep artist information, and more. Plus, it scrobbles!". Created for Last.fm as an universal build. I am very proud of this app and use it myself as a replacement for the native music app on my iPhone and iPad.
