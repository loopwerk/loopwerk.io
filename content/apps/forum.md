#  Agenda Groninger Forum
View the program and Twitter feed for a local institute. Available as an universal build. Looking back, the iPad version was a poor effort, simply a bigger version of the iPhone app. It was my first universal app though, and I do like the dark design. After I submitted this app, I rewrote the "Agenda Oosterpoort" app to be universal as well.
