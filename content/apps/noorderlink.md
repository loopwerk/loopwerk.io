#  Noorderlink
After I created two iOS app using native development tools and Objective-c, I decided to give Appcelerator Titanium another try, mainly because the client wanted an Android app as well. At first [everything was going well](/articles/2010/once-again-i-turn-appcelerator/), but in the end we got two mediocre apps and decided to start from scratch, using native SDK's for both iOS and Android. I'm glad that we did.
